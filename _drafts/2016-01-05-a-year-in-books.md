I have been consciously trying to read more for several years, but 2015 was
the first year where I set myself a tangible, albeit modest, goal: 20 books
during the course of the year, just under two books per month. 

Why read? One might say quality trumps quantity here, and I certainly agree.
Books should be absorbed and enjoyed, and not "read to have read", as
explained with regret by Alan Jacobs in [The Pleasures of Reading in an Age of
Distraction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9859899-the-pleasures-of-reading-in-an-age-of-distraction).
