In [The Mythical
Man-Month](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13629.The_Mythical_Man_Month)
Brooks discusses iterative development and metaphors for programming:

So *growing* programs never caught on. 40 years later, no single phrase
sounds off: you could be writing, developing, making, building (or finishing
-- if you do sprints). But the idea sparks a thought experiment to predict the way
we might talk about programming in the future. Given genetic algorithms,
neural networks, and frequent news about another robot who has *learned* to
speak at the level of a 4-year-old, perhaps we developers will be *raising*
programs during our daily grind.
