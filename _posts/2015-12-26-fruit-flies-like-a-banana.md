The go-to example to illustrate ambiguity in any introductory natural language
processing course is *Time flies like an arrow*. I never realised just how
ambiguous the sentence actually is before coming across this passage in Steven
Pinker's [The Language Instinct](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5755.The_Language_Instinct):

> Computer parsers are too meticulous for their own good. They find
> ambiguities that are quite legitimate, as far as English grammar is
> concerned, but that would never occur to a sane person. One of the first
> computer parsers, developed at Harvard in the 1960s, provides a famous
> example. The sentence *Time flies like an arrow* is surely unambiguous if
> there ever was an unambiguous sentence (ignoring the difference between
> literal and metaphorical meanings, which have nothing to do with syntax).
> But to the surprise of the programmers, the sharp-eyed computer found it to
> have five different trees!
>
> - Time proceeds as quickly as an arrow proceeds. (the intended reading)
> - Measure the speed of flies in the same way that you measure the speed of
>   an arrow.
> - Measure the speed of flies in the same way that an arrow measures the
>   speed of flies.
> - Measure the speed of flies that resemble an arrow.
> -  Flies of a particular kind, time-flies, are fond of an arrow.
>
> Among computer scientists the discovery has been summed up in the aphorism
> "Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana."
