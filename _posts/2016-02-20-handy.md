Running for the 14th time, an annual student design competition has taken
place as part of CHI,Â one of the most prestigious conferences in the field of
human-computer interaction.

This year, the brief was simple: [do good through
assistive technology](https://chi2016.acm.org/wp/student-design-competition).
I had good fun with a team of [UCLIC](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/uclic) students,
developing a conceptual design proposal for a device that helps people
remember to take their medication. Sadly our project wasn't selected for the
final round, but I will be keeping my fingers crossed for two other UCL teams
who are flying to San Jose for CHI 2016 to present their proposals!

Below is an outline of my team's submission. If there's one thing I'm taking
away from the experience it's that thermoplastic is absolutely indispensible
for physical prototyping.
