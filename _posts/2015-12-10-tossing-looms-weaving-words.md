With a lot of writing assignments due in the upcoming months, I have been
going through different style guides and manuals from [Strunk &
White][elementsofstyle] to Pinker's [The Sense of Style][senseofstyle].
Beneath all the instruction on spelling, the Oxford comma, paragraph
structure, active vs passive voice, avoiding garden paths (sentences that
cause the reader to backtrack), getting rid of needless words, taunting
academese, and fretting over nonissues such as "focused" vs "focussed", there
is the underlying purpose to make text accessible to the reader. The nature of
this kind of accessibility is captured tentatively in this snippet from [The
Elements of Typographic Style][typographicstyle] (which coincidentally
describes the etymology of the word "text" itself):

> An ancient metaphor: thought is a thread, and the raconteur is a spinner of
> yarns – but the true storyteller, the poet, is a weaver. The scribes made
> this old and audible abstraction into a new and visible fact. After long
> practice, their work took on such an even, flexible texture that they called
> the written page a *textus*, which means cloth.

There is certainly something appealing about encoding your thoughts in such a
way that the thread makes an even texture, and keeping the analogy in mind
the next time I face the dilemma between a colon and a dash should help to
focus on the big picture.

As an aside, a similar idea of a "knitted castle" was used
by Rich Hickey in his talk [Simple Made
Easy](https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/SimpleMadeEasy.md)
to warn developers against threading too tightly ("tossing the loom"):

> [...] are you programming with a loom? You know, you're having a great time. You're
throwing that shuttle back and forth. And what's coming out the other side is
this knotted, you know, mess. I mean it may look pretty, but you have this
problem. Right? What is the problem? The problem is the knitted castle
problem.

To be clear, Hickey is not telling developers to weave more elegantly here;
when building a castle, he would rather not weave at all and just go for
Legos. Prose and code obviously differ in what makes them accessible, not
least because one is static and the other dynamic in time (hence the Lego
blocks for easier reshuffling). Still, both encode human thought, and, even if
only as a provocative exercise, it might be interesting to pull the thread
(pun intended) and think about whether the same high-level principles apply to
coding that do to writing: unambiguous connections, logical continuity,
engaging storytelling.

Here is a list of all the resources I've found useful when thinking about
accessible writing:

- [Writing in the Sciences][sciwrite] is a free Stanford online course that
  tackles the specifics of academic writing. It consists of two major
  parts: how to write well, and how to write to get published. Each lecture
  presents a few useful items that together form a practical checklist
  of what to avoid to make your writing better. Instead of trying to be
  brilliant immediately, avoiding common pitfalls could be a simpler first
  step towards developing a good personal style!

- [The Elements of Typographic Style][typographicstyle] is hardly a guide on
  writing well, but I consider it a valuable resource when it comes to the
  specific question about accessibility. Beyond practical accessibility, there
  is also the concern that text can surely never be perceived in isolation
  from its presentation, so the way it is typeset must have
  some impact on the stance the reader takes on it; here, the book serves as a
  source of inspiration.

  The 2004 hardcover edition, by the way, looks and feels stunning, so much so
  that you would think it is strictly a display book. In reality I have been
  using my copy as a reference for several years, but without margin scribbles
  or dog-ears it takes me a fair bit of time to find anything!

- [The Sense of Style][senseofstyle] by Steven Pinker will make you think in
  tree structures. And, according to Pinker, this is just the way to think
  about your writing if you want it to make unambiguous sense. What I love
  most about this book is that in no way does Pinker present just another list
  of rules that we should blindly follow. Yes, he does come up with his own
  list of dos and don'ts which he is "prepared to try to dissuade you from
  using in their nonstandard senses", but a later statement he makes sums up
  very well why it is necessary to keep some rules to a higher standard
  despite the generic indetermination that characterises English usage:

  > Still, a few common errors are so uncontroversial ... that they have become
  tantamount to the confession "I am illiterate," and no writer should be
  caught making them. As I mentioned, the problem with these errors is not
  that they betray an absence of logical thinking but that they betray a
  history of inattention to the printed page.

  Full disclosure: Pinker's book may have made me unreasonably giddy. [Rachael
  Cayley's thoughtful
  review](http://explorationsofstyle.com/2015/02/26/in-support-of-academic-writing/)
  adds justified criticisms to the praise.

- [How to Write a Sentence and How to Read one][sentence] complements Pinker's
  practical guide in a way that focuses more on style, and attempts to teach
  the reader to recognise and produce sentences that are not only structurally
  sound, but a pleasure to read. I'm not convinced that good style can be
  acquired through learning alone. Still, the abundance of example passages
  presented that leverage one stylistic device or another will at the least
  encourage more mindful reading, creating more opportunities for picking up
  effective techniques through conscious or subconscious copying.

- [The Elements of Style][elementsofstyle] is the classic early 20th century
  reference book (or should I say booklet?) for correct writing. Pinker and
  other authors suggest that this guide be taken with a grain of salt: not
  only is it out of date, but strictly following all of the rules within is a
  recipe for making any writing bland. When it comes to looking up specific
  grammar or spelling rules, though, it is a good resource.
